1)Miss rate decreases on going from 8K unified direct-mapped L1 cache to 16K unified direct-mapped L1 cache
2)Miss rate decreases on increasing associativity from 1 to 2 
3)Miss rate decreases on increasing block size
4)Miss rate increases on spliting L1 cache
5)Miss rate of L2 is much greater than miss rate of L1
6)Capacity miss rate of L2 is 0
7)Miss rate of instruction of L2 is 1
8)Graph of miss rate vs block-size decreases then increases slightly
9)Graph of miss rate vs associativity decreases
10)If associativity is held constant in miss rate vs associativity graph then with increase in block-size miss rate decreases
11)If block-size is held constant in miss rate vs block-size then with increase in unified cache miss rate decreases
